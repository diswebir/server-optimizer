### 🚀 Hey there! Ready to Simplify Your Linux Life?

Running a Linux system is great, but managing users can be a bit of a headache. This script makes it super easy! It's a handy, interactive tool that puts all the important user stuff in one place. You won't have to mess around with a bunch of different commands in the terminal anymore. 🛠️

**Here's what you can do:**

-   **User Management Made Simple:** It's a breeze to **add ➕, delete 🗑️, or edit ✍️** users. Adding a new user? No problem! Need to remove an old one and all their files? Done. You can even handle their groups easily, like adding a new user to the `sudo` or `docker` group with just a couple of clicks. It saves you a ton of time and prevents mistakes.

-   **Lock Down Your System:** Keep things extra safe! You can lock 🔒 or unlock 🔓 user accounts in a flash. Locking an account is a great way to temporarily block a user from logging in without deleting their account entirely. Plus, the script helps you set up strong password rules so no one can guess them. It makes sure every new password is secure, including a minimum length of 8 characters and a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters! 🛡️

-   **Keep an Eye on Things:** Want to know what a user is up to? You can quickly check their **CPU 📈, memory 🧠, and disk usage 💾**. This is super useful for spotting any sneaky processes that are slowing down your system or users who are taking up too much space. Keeping an eye on resources helps your system run smoothly.

-   **No-Fuss Setup:** No more worrying about missing programs. The script is smart---it checks for anything it needs, like `libpam-pwquality`, and asks if you want to install it for you. This means you can just run it and get to work, without having to Google for what's missing. ✅

Basically, it's a simple, all-in-one tool to keep your system safe and organized. You're going to love it! 🌟
